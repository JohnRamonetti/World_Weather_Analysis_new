# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6 - API's and World Weather

## Objective
### Module 6 is an exploration into API's, including OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps API's.
### After the initial API exploration in the Module, the Challenge then further explored mining API data.  The data was put into DataFrames, reviewed, cleaned up and exported into csv files.  The resulting information was then further used to prepare HeatMaps and ultimately the core of a trip-planning app.


## Resources
- Source Data: OpenWeatherMap API, Google Maps API, NumPy Random Number Generator (for Latitudes, Longitudes)
- Software:  Python 3.7.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CityPy, Python Reqests, API's, JSON Traversals

## Results
### The three parts of the Challenge included:
  1.  Retrieve Weather Data
      - Deliverable 1: The Weather_Database folder:
      -     The Weather_Database.ipynb file
      -     The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

  2.  Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
      - Deliverable 2: The Vacation_Search folder:
      -     The Vacation_Search.ipynb file
      -     The WeatherPy_vacation.csv file
      -     The WeatherPy_vacation_map.png image

  3.  Create a Travel Itinerary Map
      - Deliverable 3: The Vacation_Itinerary folder:
      -     The Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb file
      -     The WeatherPy_travel_map.png image
      -     The WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png image


## Summary
### API's (Application Programming Interfaces) are the internet.  Information floats around the internet via various API interfaces and is available (sometimes free, sometime for a cost) to developers and curious amateurs alike.
